                <h3>Nusa Penida</h3>
                    <p>Nusa Penida is only a 35-minute boat ride from Bali but it’s a completely different world. The contrast between the pretty touristic Bali life and this original Indonesian lifestyle is quite noticeable. The sightseeing of Nusa Penida is amazing, so it won’t surprise you that its very popular among tourists. It’s most famous for the enormous cliffs and beautiful beaches. You’ll have to break a sweat and climb some steep stairs, but in the end it’s totally worth it.</p>

                <h3>Ubud ricefields</h3>
                    <p>A trip through Bali is not complete without a visit to Ubud. It is the cultural heart of Bali where many creative expats and locals live. Think of artists, writers, digital nomads and people who have started their own business here such as a yoga studio or eco lodge. The last 10 years Ubud has become very popular and therefore the center is very busy and touristy. But don't be disappointed by that first impression because once you're out of the center you'll find yourself in the middle of green rice fields and traditional villages.</p>

                <h3>Canggu</h3>
                    <p>Canggu is by far the most popular destination in Bali and perhaps even in all of Asia. What was once a sleepy surf town is now a collection of trendy restaurants, bars, beach clubs and boutique shops. You don't come here for sightseeing, but purely for the lifestyle of delicious and healthy food, shopping sessions, fun parties and if you can, surfing. If this sounds good to you, Canggu is a great destination to start your journey through Bali. It is only 1 hour drive from the airport.</p>

                <h3>Nusa Lembongan</h3>
                    <p>Nusa Lembongan is a small paradise island just below Bali. You can get there in 30 minutes by boat and the fun can start right away. Here you will find great beaches, rugged cliffs and above all a very relaxed atmosphere. All this makes Nusa Lembongan the perfect place to end your trip through Bali and relax for a few more days. Nusa Lembongan is connected to Nusa Ceningan by a bridge, so you can easily explore both islands.</p>
