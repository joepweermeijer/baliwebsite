               <h3>Rent a scooter!</h3>
                    <p>
                        It is ideal to rent a scooter in Bali and go on the road. Nature is especially beautiful in the vicinity of Ubud. Get off the main road and meander along the narrow countryside roads. In addition to giving you a wonderful feeling, it also gives you complete freedom. Renting a scooter in Bali is dirt cheap and will cost you about €4 per day.

               <h3>Visit Waterfalls</h3>
                <p>
                    There is no shortage of waterfalls in Bali. The highest waterfall in Bali is the Gitgit waterfall, which is especially impressive in the rainy season (between November and March). It is no less than 35 meters high and you can find it in the north of Bali. Another beautiful waterfall is Tegenungan waterfall near Ubud. This is the most famous waterfall in Bali so I recommend that you visit it early in the morning to avoid the crowds.

               <h3>Visit Temples</h3>
               <p>
                Despite the fact that Bali has been touristy for years, the island has managed to preserve its culture very well. You regularly see a ceremony on the street and locals in traditional clothing. There are also a huge number of temples in Bali, of all shapes and sizes. You cannot leave Bali without visiting a number of these temples.

               <h3>Climb a vulcano</h3>
               <p>
                Do you want to test your perseverance? Then go climb a volcano! Since Mount Agung is very active at the moment, it is not possible to climb it. Fortunately, you can climb Mount Batur and with a height of 1710 meters you have a great view from the top during the sunrise. This tour will cost you about €38 per person.
               </p>
